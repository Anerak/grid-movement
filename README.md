# Grid Movement

Experimenting with moving objects from one **`div`** to another.  
The **`three`** folder contains an example using a [3x3 grid][0], with basic functionality for the movement.

The file present at the main folder has a [grid of 10x10][1].

In addition, the latest presents mechanics for path editing.
